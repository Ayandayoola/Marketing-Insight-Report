### Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Sample Superstore data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can enhance business decision-making. The dataset includes categorical data such as Ship Mode, Segment, Country, City, State, Region, Category, and Subcategory, as well as numerical data such as Postal Codes, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing business performance and forecasting future sales. Power BI was used for data visualization to make insights more accessible.

### Data Exploration
The initial phase involved data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency. Key variables analyzed include Sales, Discount, and Profit. Descriptive statistics and visualizations such as histograms and pie charts were used to examine distributions, detect outliers, and identify patterns. Slicers were used to enhance data exploration by enabling easy filtering based on State and City. Cards highlighted key performance metrics, providing an instant overview of sales trends.
